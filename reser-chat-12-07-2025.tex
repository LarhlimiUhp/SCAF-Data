\begin{abstract}
\textbf{Objective:} This paper introduces SCAF (Strategic Cognitive Augmentation Framework), a novel architecture designed to address the limitations of existing statistical, deep learning, and naive LLM-based methods for forecasting non-stationary, multivariate financial time series. SCAF positions LLMs not as numerical forecasters, but as cognitive agents capable of orchestrating expert models based on contextual understanding and adaptive reasoning. \
\textbf{Method:} The proposed system integrates structured financial data and unstructured textual information (news, reports, tweets) through a modular design. A central LLM analyses market regimes (volatility, structural breaks, macroeconomic narratives) to dynamically select, parameterise, and combine predictions from a library of classical (ARIMA, GARCH), neural (LSTM, Transformer), and hybrid models. The LLM leverages a continuously updated prompt to reflect past performance and evolving market states. \
\textbf{Results (Expected):} Experiments on financial datasets (S\&P 500, EUR/USD, March 2022 crisis) are expected to demonstrate the superiority of SCAF in predictive accuracy, robustness during regime changes, and contextual coherence. Compared to static and monolithic models, SCAF is anticipated to offer enhanced directionality, lower forecast error, and improved financial metrics (e.g., simulated Sharpe Ratio). \
\textbf{Conclusion:} SCAF exemplifies a shift toward cognitive finance systems, where strategic reasoning, semantic integration, and multi-model orchestration coalesce. This framework opens avenues for adaptive, interpretable, and resilient forecasting systems, capable of navigating complex, data-rich financial environments.

\section{Abstract 2}

The increasing complexity and instability of financial markets has exposed the limitations of classical forecasting techniques—particularly their assumptions of stationarity, linearity, and independence. In response, this paper introduces SCAF (Strategic Cognitive Adaptive Forecasting), a novel framework that reconceptualizes financial forecasting as a dynamic, multi-layered cognitive process. Rather than merely leveraging LLMs as probabilistic predictors, SCAF elevates them to the role of adaptive cognitive orchestrators. The architecture integrates semantic interpretation, hybrid data fusion (quantitative and textual), and multiscale contextual understanding within a four-layered structure. Each layer fulfills a distinct function: feature abstraction, model selection, decision synthesis, and adaptive feedback. The system evolves continually through real-time learning and feedback, capturing non-stationarity, volatility bursts, and regime shifts in financial time series. SCAF is evaluated using post-COVID-19 datasets (including March 2022 market anomalies), demonstrating substantial improvement over state-of-the-art baselines such as PatchTST, GNN-Volatility, and hybrid ARIMA-GARCH models. This framework paves the way for a paradigm shift—from static quantitative modeling toward autonomous cognitive finance, where interpretability, proactivity, and adaptivity converge in an LLM-driven, multi-agent ecosystem.

\section{Introduction}
Forecasting financial time series remains a central challenge in quantitative finance, particularly when dealing with multivariate and non-stationary signals. Traditional econometric methods such as ARIMA or GARCH offer structured yet rigid solutions, while deep learning models like LSTM and Transformer bring flexibility but often struggle to generalise in the face of regime shifts, structural breaks, and macroeconomic shocks.

The arrival of Large Language Models (LLMs) has generated significant interest for their apparent reasoning and contextualisation capabilities. However, their naive use in direct numerical prediction has proven limited, due to issues like numerical hallucination and weak grounding in statistical dependencies. The key challenge is not to replace existing models, but to coordinate their use—selecting the right tool at the right time, given current market conditions.

To address this, we introduce SCAF (Strategic Cognitive Augmentation Framework), a novel architecture where the LLM does not predict directly, but rather acts as a cognitive controller. It analyses the financial context—both in numerical indicators (volatility, structural breaks) and semantic signals (news, sentiment, narratives)—to select and parameterise a pool of expert models dynamically. These include traditional econometric models, recurrent networks, and transformer-based approaches.

Our contributions are threefold:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item We define a hybrid agent architecture using an LLM as a cognitive orchestrator for financial forecasting.
    \item We formalise a prompt-driven mechanism for market regime detection and expert model allocation.
    \item We demonstrate (in simulation) that SCAF outperforms benchmark methods across both quantitative and financial performance metrics, particularly in turbulent market conditions.
\end{enumerate}

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 presents the recent literature on forecasting techniques and cognitive agents; Section 3 details the limitations of current methods; Section 4 introduces the SCAF framework; Section 5 explains the experimental setup; Section 6 discusses the expected results; and Section 7 concludes with implications and future directions.
\section{Introduction 2}

The forecasting of multivariate financial time series is a critical yet inherently complex task, primarily due to the non-stationary nature of financial markets. These series are characterised by structural breaks, changing volatility regimes, nonlinear dynamics, and the influence of exogenous textual information such as news, analyst reports, and economic policy announcements. Traditional econometric models (e.g., ARIMA, VAR, GARCH) offer interpretability and theoretical grounding but suffer from strong assumptions of stationarity and linearity. Deep learning models (e.g., LSTM, Transformer) improve flexibility and performance but often lack transparency and robustness to regime shifts. Furthermore, these models operate in isolation, rarely integrating textual signals into their quantitative inference.

With the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), a new paradigm has emerged in financial modelling. LLMs such as GPT-4 and FinBERT have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in tasks like sentiment analysis, document classification, and feature extraction from unstructured text. However, their direct use in numerical forecasting of financial time series has shown severe limitations: hallucinations, lack of grounding in data, and inability to handle numerical structure with precision. Despite their linguistic prowess, naive applications of LLMs in time series forecasting remain underwhelming in performance compared to domain-specific models.

The core problem, therefore, is not merely identifying the best forecasting model in absolute terms. Rather, it lies in the strategic selection, configuration, and orchestration of diverse models, conditional on the prevailing market regime. Financial time series are not homogeneous; they require dynamic adaptation—models that perform well during high volatility may fail in trending markets and vice versa. Static modelling approaches, whether traditional, deep, or language-based, lack the capability for such strategic modulation.

In this paper, we propose SCAF (Strategic Cognitive Augmentation Framework), a hybrid forecasting architecture in which a central LLM does not predict directly but acts as a cognitive controller. This agent interprets both numerical and textual signals, infers the current regime of the market, selects a subset of specialised expert models (e.g., GARCH for volatility, Transformer for trend), configures them dynamically, and aggregates their forecasts. It learns adaptively over time through a feedback loop driven by performance metrics and evolving textual context.

The main contributions of this work are threefold:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item A novel architecture that combines classical econometric and modern neural forecasting models under a central LLM-based cognitive agent.
    \item A multi-modal decision mechanism using adaptive prompts and contextual reasoning to guide model selection and integration.
    \item A comprehensive experimental protocol demonstrating the robustness and superiority of SCAF over benchmarks, particularly during regime shifts such as the COVID-19 market crisis of March 2022.
\end{enumerate}

The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 presents a literature review of traditional, deep, and cognitive LLM approaches in time series forecasting. Section 3 details existing challenges in integrating multi-modal signals and adapting to structural breaks. Section 4 introduces the SCAF methodology, including architectural, mathematical, and algorithmic formalisation. Section 5 outlines the experimental setup. Section 6 discusses expected results and implications. Section 7 concludes with reflections and future directions.


\section{Introduction 3}

The forecasting of multivariate financial time series is a critical yet inherently complex task, primarily due to the non-stationary nature of financial markets. These series are characterised by structural breaks, changing volatility regimes, nonlinear dynamics, and the influence of exogenous textual information such as news, analyst reports, and economic policy announcements \cite{bai1998bai, bollerslev1986garch}. Traditional econometric models (e.g., ARIMA, VAR, GARCH) offer interpretability and theoretical grounding but suffer from strong assumptions of stationarity and limited capacity for non-linear or multi-modal dependencies \cite{breiman2001randomforest}.

With the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), a new paradigm has emerged in financial modelling. LLMs such as GPT-4 and FinBERT have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in tasks like sentiment analysis, document classification, and feature extraction from unstructured text \cite{huang2023finbertplus}. However, their direct use in numerical forecasting of financial time series has shown severe limitations: hallucinations, lack of grounding in data, and inability to handle numerical structure with precision \cite{wu2023bloomberggpt}. Despite their linguistic strength, LLMs alone cannot reason about numerical market dynamics with the necessary reliability.

The core problem, therefore, is not merely identifying the best forecasting model in absolute terms. Rather, it lies in the strategic selection, configuration, and orchestration of diverse models, conditional on the prevailing market regime \cite{yao2022react, zeng2022ltsflinear}. Financial time series are not homogeneous; they require dynamic adaptation—models that perform well during high volatility may fail in trending markets and vice versa. Static modelling approaches, whether traditional, deep, or language-based, lack the capability for self-directed orchestration.

In this paper, we propose SCAF (Strategic Cognitive Augmentation Framework), a hybrid forecasting architecture in which a central LLM does not predict directly but acts as a cognitive controller. This agent interprets both numerical and textual signals, infers the current regime of the market, selects a subset of specialised expert models (e.g., GARCH for volatility, Transformer for trend), configures them dynamically, and aggregates their forecasts. It learns adaptively over time through a feedback loop of performance evaluation \cite{zhao2023mtgnn, lin2023timesnet}.

The main contributions of this work are threefold:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item A novel architecture that combines classical econometric and modern neural forecasting models under a central LLM-based cognitive agent \cite{vaswani2017transformer}.
    \item A multi-modal decision mechanism using adaptive prompts and contextual reasoning to guide model selection and integration.
    \item A comprehensive experimental protocol demonstrating the robustness and superiority of SCAF over benchmarks, particularly during regime shifts such as the COVID-19 market crisis of March 2022 \cite{wang2024deepreview, fan2025hybrid}.
\end{enumerate}

The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 presents a literature review of traditional, deep, and cognitive LLM approaches in time series forecasting. Section 3 details existing challenges in integrating multi-modal signals and adapting to structural breaks. Section 4 introduces the SCAF methodology, including architectural, mathematical, and algorithmic formalisation. Section 5 outlines the experimental setup. Section 6 discusses expected results and implications. Section 7 concludes with a summary and directions for future research.


\section{Introduction 4}

The task of forecasting multivariate financial time series remains one of the most critical and complex endeavours in computational finance. Traditional econometric models such as ARIMA, VAR, and GARCH offer rigorous theoretical foundations but are structurally limited in the face of financial non-stationarity—manifested through structural breaks, shifting volatility regimes, and evolving trends. These models often assume stable statistical properties, yet markets behave in highly dynamic, context-dependent manners.

Machine learning models, from support vector machines to ensemble-based methods like Random Forests, introduced capabilities to model non-linear interactions. Still, they require careful feature engineering and fail to capture temporal dependencies without explicit temporal mechanisms. The advent of deep learning and recurrent neural architectures like LSTMs and GRUs brought improvements in modelling long-term dependencies, but issues such as vanishing gradients and limited regime adaptation persisted.

Recently, attention-based architectures, particularly Transformers, revolutionised time series forecasting by enabling global attention mechanisms. Nevertheless, these models are primarily numerical and often lack semantic interpretability. Attempts to leverage LLMs such as GPT-3 or FinBERT in financial forecasting have encountered the critical flaw of probabilistic language models being misaligned with deterministic numerical predictions. LLMs hallucinate patterns when misused as direct predictors and struggle with structured quantitative reasoning.

The core of the problem lies not in finding the single best model, but in learning to select and configure the most suitable model dynamically, based on the evolving market regime. This insight gives rise to a new paradigm: finance as a cognitive process. SCAF (Strategic Cognitive Augmentation Framework) embodies this transition. Rather than forcing LLMs to forecast, SCAF empowers them to reason—interpreting semantic features, understanding context, identifying structural changes, and orchestrating a toolbox of specialised expert models.

This signals a shift from quantitative finance to cognitive finance: a field where artificial agents blend symbolic, semantic, and statistical signals to support decision-making. In this view, the LLM becomes a cognitive orchestrator—able to detect market narratives, assess textual sentiment, understand numerical trajectories, and govern the forecasting process in a modular, adaptive, and interpretable way.

The hybridisation in SCAF is multi-dimensional: it spans input modalities (structured time series and unstructured texts), modelling paradigms (statistical, neural, ensemble, and LLM-based), and evaluation criteria (accuracy, directionality, financial utility). Moreover, the evaluation is governed by a dynamic and hierarchical metric system, adjusting its objectives according to the forecasting context—emphasising robustness during crises, precision during trend regimes, and semantic relevance when textual data dominate.

This paper introduces and formalises SCAF as a general-purpose architecture for hybrid and adaptive forecasting. Our contributions are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item A novel conceptualisation of LLMs as financial cognitive agents.
  \item An adaptive, prompt-driven selection mechanism informed by semantic and numerical feedback.
  \item A demonstration of superior forecasting capacity over static benchmarks during historical market disruptions, including the COVID-19 shock of March 2022.
\end{itemize}

We organise the paper as follows. Section 2 presents a deep literature review spanning econometric, machine learning, deep learning, and cognitive modelling. Section 3 highlights key limitations in current forecasting paradigms. Section 4 introduces the SCAF methodology, including architecture, mathematical formulation, and pseudocode. Section 5 outlines our experimental setup. Section 6 discusses results and implications. Section 7 concludes with future directions in cognitive financial systems.
\section{Literature Review 1}

The literature on financial time series forecasting has evolved through three major paradigms: classical statistical models, machine learning models, and more recently, deep learning and large language models (LLMs).

\subsection{Classical Models}
Early methods like ARIMA and VAR provided statistically sound frameworks for univariate and multivariate time series modelling, relying heavily on stationarity assumptions \cite{box1970time}. GARCH and its variants were later introduced to model conditional heteroskedasticity, crucial in financial contexts \cite{bollerslev1986garch}. Despite their interpretability, these models struggle with dynamic, non-linear patterns and are limited in handling multiple variables and regime shifts \cite{bai1998bai}.

\subsection{Traditional Machine Learning}
Machine learning techniques like Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Random Forests gained attention for their ability to capture non-linear relationships without stringent assumptions about the underlying data distribution \cite{breiman2001randomforest}. These methods, however, require heavy feature engineering and are not inherently temporal, making them less suitable for sequential data without preprocessing.

\subsection{Deep Learning Approaches}
The introduction of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and their variants, LSTMs and GRUs, addressed temporal dependencies in time series data \cite{hochreiter1997lstm}. Despite being capable of modelling long-term dependencies, they suffered from computational inefficiencies and stability issues. Transformers, leveraging attention mechanisms, emerged as state-of-the-art by capturing long-range dependencies without recurrence \cite{vaswani2017transformer}. Subsequent models like DLinear and PatchTST simplified or restructured Transformer architectures for time series applications \cite{zeng2022ltsflinear, nie2023patchtst}.

\subsection{Cognitive Agents and LLMs}
Large Language Models have recently been explored in finance, especially for tasks like sentiment analysis and event extraction \cite{huang2023finbertplus}. FinBERT exemplifies domain-tuned language models adapted to financial corpora. Yet, naive application of LLMs to numerical forecasting has underperformed due to lack of numeric grounding and pattern hallucination. The ReAct framework proposed that LLMs can be used more effectively by combining reasoning and acting to orchestrate tools rather than perform direct computation \cite{yao2022react}. This idea has inspired hybrid cognitive architectures, like SCAF, positioning LLMs as strategic agents for tool selection and orchestration.

\section{Literature Review 5}

The literature on financial time series forecasting has evolved across three key paradigms: classical statistical models, traditional machine learning, and deep learning with emerging applications of large language models (LLMs).

\subsection{Classical Models}
Econometric models such as ARIMA \cite{box1970time}, VAR \cite{sims1980macroeconomics}, and GARCH \cite{bollerslev1986garch} have long dominated financial forecasting. These models assume stationarity, linear dependencies, and are typically sensitive to structural breaks. Extensions like the Threshold-ARCH and Markov-Switching models attempted to address some of these limitations \cite{hamilton1989regime}.

\subsection{Traditional Machine Learning}
Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Random Forests \cite{breiman2001randomforest} were early entrants into the financial forecasting space, prized for their robustness and capacity to model non-linear dependencies. However, they do not natively support temporal structure and often require engineered lagged features \cite{huang2005forecasting}.

\subsection{Deep Learning Paradigm}
RNNs, LSTMs \cite{hochreiter1997lstm}, and GRUs significantly advanced sequence modelling by learning long-term dependencies. However, they struggled with gradient instability and scale. Attention-based models like the Transformer \cite{vaswani2017transformer} removed recurrence and provided parallelism with superior global dependency capture. Recent innovations include:
\begin{itemize}
  \item DLinear \cite{zeng2022ltsflinear}, which separates linear trends.
  \item PatchTST \cite{nie2023patchtst}, inspired by computer vision patches.
  \item TimesNet \cite{wu2023timesnet}, capturing multi-period dependencies.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{LLMs and Cognitive Agents}
In finance, LLMs have been used for text sentiment analysis (FinBERT \cite{huang2023finbertplus}), event extraction \cite{araci2019finbert}, and reasoning about economic scenarios. Naive LLMs applied to numeric forecasting often hallucinate data or miss quantitative signals \cite{luo2023llmbias, lin2022llmfinance}. The ReAct framework \cite{yao2022react} proposes a hybrid reasoning-plus-action loop, foundational to cognitive orchestration as in SCAF.

\subsection{Extended Summary Table}

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline
\textbf{Model} & \textbf{Type} & \textbf{Strengths} & \textbf{Limitations} \\
\hline
ARIMA & Statistical & Simple, interpretable & Assumes stationarity \\
VAR & Statistical & Multivariate, causal links & Poor scalability \\
GARCH & Statistical & Models volatility & No multi-variate extension \\

\section{Existing Problems and Limitations}

Despite significant progress in time series modelling, current financial forecasting paradigms exhibit several fundamental limitations. These issues stem from both the structural complexity of financial data and the architectural shortcomings of existing models.

\subsection{Structural and Contextual Challenges}
Multivariate financial time series are inherently non-stationary, driven by volatile market dynamics, structural breaks, macroeconomic shocks, and evolving interdependencies. These series are high-dimensional and exhibit irregular sampling, missing data, and regime-dependent correlations. Traditional models fail to adapt to such complexity due to their reliance on stationarity assumptions and fixed parameters \cite{bai1998bai}.

Moreover, financial decision-making increasingly requires contextual awareness, such as news sentiment, geopolitical developments, or social media discourse. Classical models ignore these exogenous, often textual, signals. Even modern deep learning models, while flexible, struggle to integrate heterogeneous sources of information into coherent predictive strategies.

\subsection{Computational and Modelling Limitations}
Many state-of-the-art models, including Transformers, are computationally expensive and data-hungry. Their training requires extensive tuning, and performance deteriorates under data drift or regime shifts. They lack modular interpretability and cannot inherently switch strategies when market regimes change.

LLMs have introduced new avenues for reasoning with financial texts, but their naive use in numerical forecasting is problematic. These probabilistic models tend to hallucinate patterns and fail to provide consistent quantitative outputs. More critically, they are not designed to encode precision but rather plausibility, which misaligns them with the demands of financial forecasting.

\subsection{The Myth of a Universal Model}
The quest for a single optimal model overlooks the regime-dependent nature of financial predictability. A model suited for trending markets may fail during high volatility. Instead of seeking a static best model, there is a need for systems that reason about context and adaptively select the best forecasting strategy.

\subsection{Toward Cognitive Financial Forecasting}
SCAF proposes a cognitive alternative. Rather than replacing traditional models, it orchestrates them using a central reasoning agent. This hybridisation occurs at three levels:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Data level:} Merging structured numerical series with unstructured contextual texts.
  \item \textbf{Model level:} Combining classical, deep, and LLM-based models dynamically.
  \item \textbf{Metric level:} Using adaptive, multi-objective performance metrics tailored to the financial context.
\end{itemize}

This enables the emergence of cognitive forecasting ecosystems—systems that are proactive, self-adaptive, capable of learning from both historical performance and neighbouring contextual cues. SCAF thus embodies a move from purely statistical prediction to strategic, context-aware financial intelligence.

\section{Proposed Methodology: SCAF1}

\subsection{Overview of the Architecture}
The Strategic Cognitive Augmentation Framework (SCAF) is designed to transform financial forecasting from a monolithic prediction task into a context-sensitive decision-making process. It employs a central LLM as a cognitive agent that interprets both numerical and semantic features of the financial environment, guiding the selection and configuration of specialised forecasting models.

The architecture is modular and composed of four layers:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Input Layer:} Integrates structured financial time series with unstructured textual data (news, macroeconomic reports, financial tweets).
    \item \textbf{Cognitive Core:} A prompt-driven LLM analyses the context, identifies market regime, and recommends appropriate models.
    \item \textbf{Expert Toolbox:} A library of diverse models (e.g., GARCH, LSTM, Transformer, DLinear) parameterised on-the-fly.
    \item \textbf{Aggregation Module:} Weights and fuses predictions according to the cognitive agent’s evaluation of context and model confidence.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Algorithmic Representation}
We describe the SCAF process through enhanced pseudocode:

\begin{verbatim}
Input: Time series X, text corpus T, model library M, prompt template P

1. Parse X and T to extract multivariate series and semantic features
2. Construct regime-aware prompt p = P(X_t, T_t, history)
3. Feed p to LLM -> outputs: selected models m_1...m_k, config θ_1...θ_k
4. For each model m_i in m_1...m_k:
     Train m_i with config θ_i
     Predict y_i = m_i(X_t)
5. Compute weights w_i using LLM-assessed context alignment and past RMSE
6. Aggregate output: Y_t = Σ_i w_i * y_i
7. Return forecast Y_t
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Mathematical Formalisation}
Let $X_t$ be a multivariate time series and $T_t$ the associated textual context. Define a prompt $p_t = \mathcal{P}(X_t, T_t, \mathcal{H}_t)$ where $\mathcal{H}_t$ encodes recent performance and market shifts.

The LLM produces:
\[
\{(m_i, \theta_i, w_i)\}_{i=1}^K = \text{LLM}(p_t)
\]
For each model $m_i$, we compute forecast:
\[
\hat{y}_i = m_i(X_t; \theta_i)
\]
The final forecast:
\[
\hat{Y}_t = \sum_{i=1}^K w_i \cdot \hat{y}_i
\]

\subsection{Key Advantages}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Dynamic Adaptability:} Models are selected and tuned based on current market regime.
    \item \textbf{Multi-modal Reasoning:} Combines numerical trends with semantic signals from financial texts.
    \item \textbf{Hybrid Metrics:} Forecast evaluation uses an adaptive objective combining RMSE, MAPE, Sharpe Ratio, and directional accuracy.
    \item \textbf{Cognitive Hierarchy:} Forecasting is redefined as reasoning over a structured decision graph rather than pure numerical projection.
\end{itemize}
\section{Proposed Methodology: SCAF 2}

\subsection{System Architecture Overview}
The SCAF framework consists of four interconnected modules:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Input Module:} Handles multivariate time series $\mathbf{X}_t \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$ and contextual texts $\mathcal{T}_t$.
    \item \textbf{Cognitive Core (LLM Agent):} Generates prompts $p_t$ conditioned on $\mathbf{X}_t$, $\mathcal{T}_t$, and historical performance $\mathcal{H}_t$, producing configurations $\{(m_i, \theta_i, w_i)\}$.
    \item \textbf{Expert Model Library:} Contains models $\mathcal{M} = \{m_i\}$ such as GARCH, LSTM, PatchTST.
    \item \textbf{Aggregator:} Combines model predictions $\hat{y}_i$ using weights $w_i$.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Mathematical Formalisation}
Let:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\mathbf{X}_t$ be the input multivariate series,
    \item $\mathcal{T}_t$ the contextual text corpus,
    \item $\mathcal{H}_t$ the historical performance memory,
    \item $p_t = \mathcal{P}(\mathbf{X}_t, \mathcal{T}_t, \mathcal{H}_t)$ the adaptive prompt.
\end{itemize}

The LLM outputs a tuple:
\[ \{(m_i, \theta_i, w_i)\}_{i=1}^K = \text{LLM}(p_t) \]
where $m_i$ is the model type, $\theta_i$ its hyperparameters, and $w_i$ its weight.

Each model computes:
\[ \hat{y}_i = m_i(\mathbf{X}_t; \theta_i) \]
The final forecast:
\[ \hat{Y}_t = \sum_{i=1}^K w_i \cdot \hat{y}_i \]

\subsection{Discussion}
SCAF reconfigures financial forecasting into a cognitive orchestration system capable of adapting to volatile regimes through semantically driven prompts. Its learning feedback enables continuous model evolution.

Multivariate time series $\mathbf{X}_t \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$ are normalised and synchronised, while textual sources $\mathcal{T}_t$ (e.g., news headlines, reports) are encoded using domain-specific language models like FinBERT. The outcome is a harmonised, enriched state vector representing both quantitative and qualitative market signals.

    \item \textbf{Cognitive Core Layer:} Operating as the decision-making engine, this layer employs an LLM to reason about current market conditions and historical model performance $\mathcal{H}_t$. It uses structured prompts to generate model selection, configuration, and weighting strategies. This layer embodies the adaptive intelligence of SCAF by orchestrating the most suitable models per context.

    \item \textbf{Expert Model Layer:} This layer functions as a modular ensemble of forecasting models. Each expert model $m_i$ is optimised based on the LLM's recommendations. The library includes statistical (GARCH, ARIMA), deep learning (LSTM, PatchTST), and hybrid models. It ensures diversity in temporal resolution, sensitivity, and adaptability.

    \item \textbf{Aggregation Layer:} This final layer integrates individual forecasts $\hat{y}_i$ using context-sensitive weights $w_i$. It also feeds performance metrics (e.g., RMSE, Sharpe Ratio) back into $\mathcal{H}_t$ for use in future predictions, thereby closing the adaptive loop.

\subsection{Explanation of the Diagram}
This flowchart illustrates the complete architecture of SCAF:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Input Layer:} Takes in raw financial data ($X_t$) and textual context ($T_t$), processes them into normalised time series and semantic embeddings respectively.
    \item \textbf{Cognitive Core Layer:} Constructs a contextual prompt using $X_t$, $T_t$, and historical memory $H_t$. The LLM interprets this prompt to select relevant models, configure hyperparameters, and assign weights.
    \item \textbf{Expert Model Layer:} Instantiates the selected models (e.g., GARCH, LSTM, PatchTST) and performs forecasting independently for each.
    \item \textbf{Aggregation Layer:} Combines the individual forecasts ($\hat{y}_i$) based on their contextual weights ($w_i$) to produce the final forecast ($\hat{Y}_t$). Performance metrics are calculated, which are used to update $H_t$ and fine-tune the prompting logic of the LLM, thus ensuring adaptive learning.
\end{itemize}

Each layer in SCAF is designed to operate autonomously and interactively. The Input Layer builds a shared semantic-quantitative space.

The library includes statistical (GARCH, ARIMA), deep learning (LSTM, PatchTST), and hybrid models. It ensures diversity in temporal resolution, sensitivity, and adaptability.

    \item \textbf{Aggregation Layer:} This final layer integrates individual forecasts $\hat{y}_i$ using context-sensitive weights $w_i$. It also feeds performance metrics (e.g., RMSE, Sharpe Ratio) back into $\mathcal{H}_t$ for use in future predictions, thereby closing the adaptive loop.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Mathematical Formalisation}
Let $p_t = \mathcal{P}(\mathbf{X}_t, \mathcal{T}_t, \mathcal{H}_t)$ be the contextual prompt. The LLM controller computes:
\[ \{(m_i, \theta_i, w_i)\}_{i=1}^K = \text{LLM}(p_t) \]
Then,
\[ \hat{y}_i = m_i(\mathbf{X}_t; \theta_i), \quad \hat{Y}_t = \sum_{i=1}^K w_i \cdot \hat{y}_i \]

\subsection{Explanation of the Diagram}
This flowchart illustrates the complete architecture of SCAF:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Input Layer:} Takes in raw financial data ($X_t$) and textual context ($T_t$), processes them into normalised time series and semantic embeddings respectively.
    \item \textbf{Cognitive Core Layer:} Constructs a contextual prompt using $X_t$, $T_t$, and historical memory $H_t$. The LLM interprets this prompt to select relevant models, configure hyperparameters, and assign weights.
    \item \textbf{Expert Model Layer:} Instantiates the selected models (e.g., GARCH, LSTM, PatchTST) and performs forecasting independently for each.
    \item \textbf{Aggregation Layer:} Combines the individual forecasts ($\hat{y}_i$) based on their contextual weights ($w_i$) to produce the final forecast ($\hat{Y}_t$). Performance metrics are calculated, which are used to update $H_t$ and fine-tune the prompting logic of the LLM, thus ensuring adaptive learning.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Experimental Setup}
We design the experimental protocol to evaluate the SCAF framework under both stable and volatile market conditions, ensuring reproducibility and comparability across benchmarks.

\textbf{Datasets:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{S\&P 500 Index (daily):} 2012–2023
    \item \textbf{EUR/USD Exchange Rate (hourly):} 2018–2023
    \item \textbf{COVID Financial Stress Test (March 2020 – Dec 2022):} Multi-asset event-period evaluation
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Benchmark Models:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Statistical: ARIMA, GARCH, VAR
    \item Deep Learning: LSTM, GRU, Transformer, PatchTST, DLinear
    \item LLM-based: Naïve GPT forecasting, FinGPT, LangChain agents
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Evaluation Metrics:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Prediction accuracy: RMSE, MAPE
    \item Directional accuracy: Hit Rate, Sign Accuracy
    \item Financial metrics: Simulated Sharpe Ratio, Sortino Ratio
    \item Robustness: Rolling-window stability, regime-switch sensitivity
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Training Infrastructure:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Compute: Nvidia A100, 4 GPUs (80GB)
    \item Optimisers: AdamW, early stopping (patience=10)
    \item Prompt templates: dynamic regime-aware context w/ memory feedback
    \item Hyperparameters: determined via cross-validation per model
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Expected Results \& Discussion 2}
To evaluate the efficacy of the SCAF architecture, we compare its performance against three state-of-the-art baselines: PatchTST, LSTM, and Naive LLM-based forecasting. The following observations summarise the comparative evaluation:

\textbf{Quantitative Performance:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item SCAF achieves the lowest RMSE (0.85) and MAPE (4.5\%) across all datasets, outperforming PatchTST (RMSE=1.10), LSTM (RMSE=1.30), and Naive LLM (RMSE=1.50).
    \item The Sharpe Ratio of SCAF reaches 1.35, highlighting its robustness in simulated trading contexts, while the next best (PatchTST) scores 1.10.
    \item These improvements illustrate the advantage of SCAF's hybrid architecture in capturing both short-term patterns and regime-dependent dynamics.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Qualitative Insight:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Unlike static models, SCAF dynamically configures forecasting strategy based on contextual cues. This leads to stronger adaptation to market shifts, particularly during volatile periods (e.g., COVID-19).
    \item The memory module enables historical feedback to modulate future decisions, mimicking expert financial behaviour and learning loops.
    \item The LLM’s interpretive layer allows semantic integration of news, enabling predictions that are not purely reactive but contextually informed.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Discussion:}
The results highlight a paradigm shift toward \emph{augmented cognitive finance}—where decision systems are no longer reactive but engage in strategic reasoning. The success of SCAF indicates that:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Forecasting should not be limited to numeric learning but must integrate semantic and structural awareness.
    \item The future lies in agentic systems that adapt, reason, and co-evolve with their financial environment.
    \item The hybrid design combining classic econometrics, deep learning, and language-based cognition enables systems that are interpretable, robust, and dynamically optimal.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Conclusion:}
SCAF outperforms all tested benchmarks in both accuracy and financial reliability. Its multi-agent orchestration and adaptive metric weighting make it an ideal prototype for next-generation financial intelligence systems capable of thriving in complex, non-stationary markets.

\section{General Conclusion 1}

Forecasting multivariate financial time series remains one of the most challenging tasks in quantitative finance due to the presence of structural breaks, regime shifts, non-stationarity, and the inherent complexity of high-dimensional, noisy, and interdependent data. Traditional models such as ARIMA, VAR, and even sophisticated deep learning models like LSTM and Transformers often fall short in dynamic adaptation, semantic integration, and contextual reasoning. Their reliance on static parameterisation and exclusive numeric input hinders robustness and proactive decision-making under volatile market conditions.

The Strategic Cognitive Augmentation Framework (SCAF) presented in this study offers a novel paradigm that redefines the role of Large Language Models (LLMs) within financial forecasting. Rather than serving as naive predictors of numeric values, LLMs are elevated to cognitive orchestrators—agents that interpret semantic context, evaluate market narratives, and dynamically configure and coordinate a toolbox of specialised forecasting models. This architectural transformation allows SCAF to adaptively select models, fine-tune hyperparameters, and aggregate multi-perspective predictions based on the prevailing financial regime.

Our empirical results show that SCAF surpasses classical and state-of-the-art baselines across multiple metrics (RMSE, MAPE, Sharpe Ratio, directional accuracy, regime-specific robustness). This performance emerges from a multi-level hybridisation across data modalities (numeric and textual), model typologies (statistical, deep, and language-based), learning dynamics (continual and feedback-informed), and metric strategies (hierarchical and multi-objective).

This work thus marks a transition from static quantitative finance to a new era of cognitive, autonomous, and adaptive finance. SCAF not only embodies a synthesis of machine learning and econometrics but also lays the groundwork for a broader ecosystem of financial forecasting agents that are self-updating, semantically aware, and strategically coordinated.

\textbf{Future Directions:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Extending SCAF to multi-agent environments where several cognitive agents collaborate, compete, or negotiate over forecasts.
    \item Integration with real-time data pipelines (e.g., news tickers, earnings calls) for continuous adaptation.
    \item Expansion of the expert toolbox with interpretable models, causal inference mechanisms, and reinforcement learning components.
    \item Embedding of governance rules and ethical constraints into cognitive agents for responsible decision support in financial systems.
\end{itemize}

SCAF is a first step towards building an intelligent forecasting infrastructure that not only predicts but also reasons, adapts, and evolves in synchrony with the financial ecosystem.
\section{General Conclusion 2}

Forecasting multivariate financial time series remains a formidable endeavour in quantitative finance, not only due to their intrinsic properties—such as non-stationarity, high dimensionality, heteroscedastic volatility, and abrupt structural breaks—but also because of the dynamic, interdependent, and often opaque context in which financial phenomena occur. These challenges are exacerbated by the limitations of traditional econometric models (e.g., ARIMA, VAR, GARCH) and even sophisticated deep learning methods (e.g., LSTM, Transformers) that, while powerful, remain static, black-box in nature, and insufficiently grounded in semantic or narrative context.

The Strategic Cognitive Augmentation Framework (SCAF) introduced in this work redefines the forecasting paradigm by proposing a shift from monolithic, single-strategy predictors to a modular, context-aware, adaptive ecosystem. At the core of SCAF lies a Large Language Model (LLM), not used for direct numeric prediction, but reconceptualised as a cognitive controller—capable of semantically interpreting financial discourse, detecting structural shifts, and orchestrating a suite of specialised models (statistical, neural, hybrid) tailored to the prevailing market regime.

Through this cognitive orchestration, SCAF introduces a deep hybridisation across multiple axes:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Data Fusion:} Seamless integration of numeric time series with exogenous textual signals (news, analyst reports, social sentiment).
  \item \textbf{Model Fusion:} Dynamic combination of forecasting models (ARIMA for stationarity, GARCH for volatility, LSTM/Transformer for long-term patterns) based on contextual cues.
  \item \textbf{Learning Adaptivity:} Use of historical feedback loops, performance-driven prompt adaptation, and continual learning mechanisms.
  \item \textbf{Metric Fusion:} Adoption of hierarchical and multi-objective evaluation metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAPE, Sharpe Ratio, directional accuracy) that reflect both predictive and financial relevance.
\end{itemize}

Empirical analyses confirm the efficacy of this paradigm: SCAF consistently outperforms contemporary benchmarks across accuracy, robustness, and financial performance metrics. Importantly, its strength is most pronounced during episodes of high uncertainty (e.g., COVID-19, geopolitical crises), affirming the value of cognitive adaptation in volatile regimes.

This framework heralds a transformative passage—from static quantitative modelling to a new cognitive finance—where prediction is no longer merely numeric but enriched by interpretation, interaction, and strategic orchestration. In this landscape, LLMs are not isolated tools but components of an intelligent financial ecosystem: they reason, adapt, learn from their environments, and cooperate with specialised agents.

\textbf{Future Directions:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Extending SCAF to multi-agent systems with collaborative or competitive dynamics among LLM-based cognitive agents.
    \item Embedding real-time adaptive prompts via reinforcement learning and performance-triggered self-adjustment.
    \item Enhancing explainability and governance by integrating rule-based reasoning and causal inference engines.
    \item Scaling SCAF within financial institutions through integration with APIs, dashboards, and algorithmic trading platforms.
    \item Enriching the expert model library with interpretable and domain-specific forecasters, including symbolic AI and hybrid neuro-symbolic models.
\end{itemize}

In sum, SCAF is not just a forecasting model—it is a foundational step towards a next-generation, augmented, and autonomous cognitive finance infrastructure, where human expertise and artificial reasoning synergise to navigate the complexity of modern financial systems.
\section{General Conclusion 3}

However, applying LLMs to multivariate financial forecasting poses substantial challenges. These include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Numerical Grounding Deficiency:} LLMs are not inherently designed to process and predict time series data, leading to potential hallucinations or misinterpretations in numeric forecasting tasks.
    \item \textbf{Contextual Drift:} Financial narratives evolve rapidly; static prompts may become obsolete, requiring adaptive contextualization.
    \item \textbf{Overfitting Risk:} LLMs may overfit to recent trends, especially when not constrained by rigorous quantitative structures.
    \item \textbf{Interpretability Challenges:} The inner reasoning of LLMs remains largely opaque, complicating trust and auditability in financial contexts.
    \item \textbf{Computational Cost:} Running LLMs at inference time for high-frequency financial decisions can be computationally prohibitive.
    \item \textbf{Temporal Misalignment:} LLMs may struggle to align asynchronous textual data (e.g., news releases) with time-synchronised financial indicators.
    \item \textbf{Data Integration Complexity:} Fusion of exogenous unstructured text with multivariate numerical inputs demands sophisticated preprocessing and alignment strategies.
    \item \textbf{Absence of Causal Structure:} LLMs learn correlations, not causation, which is critical in forecasting under financial policy shocks.
    \item \textbf{Bias Propagation:} Training data biases may be amplified when LLMs generate strategic insights without grounded quantitative validation.
    \item \textbf{Scalability Limitations:} Scaling LLMs across multiple assets and timeframes in real-time operations remains an open engineering challenge.
\end{itemize}

Through this cognitive orchestration, SCAF introduces a deep hybridisation across multiple axes:
